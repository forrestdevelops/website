    "description": "I cooked this dish for my family after a long day of playing top golf.  I cheated by getting fresh pasta and vodka sauce from Nicole Taylors Pasta and Market in Indianapolis(If you havent been there, put it on your list, its a great spot for italian groceries and food).  I made the garlic bread from scratch and the broccoli raab was from the farmers market.  I loved the combination of the vodka sauce with the bitter broccoli raab.  The garlic bread was a great addition to soak up the extra sauce; making it a perfect \"feel good\" meal. after golfing.",
